```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Run the server
node server
```

Start the application using Docker:

```bash
# Building the image
docker build --tag webrtcvideobroadcast .

# Run the image in a container
docker run -d -p 4000:4000 webrtcvideobroadcast
```

### Testing the application

The application should now be running on your localhost:4000 and you test it by connecting to localhost:4000/broadcast.html to add a new broadcaster.

After that, you just need to visit localhost:4000 to connect to the server as a client and you should get the video that is streamed from the broadcaster.

## Adding a TURN server

A TURN server is used to relay traffic if a direct peer to peer connection fails and is required for most WebRTC application since a direct socket is often not possible between two clients that aren't on the same network. This repository doesn't include the usage of a TURN server by default, but you can add one by commenting in the turn configuration in the `broadcast.js` and `watch.js` file and filling in your TURN credentials.

There are several options on how you can create your own TURN server. Here are just two common ones:


"# webrtc" 
# webrtc
# webrtc
# webrtc
